Project Overview

Browser-based vehicle tracking using a smartphone and predefined routes.

The system focuses **only on vehicle movement from Point A to Point B**, including multiple intermediate checkpoints
(A → B → Y → X).

Think of it as:

“A simple, universal, browser-based vehicle tracking solution for any business that depends on vehicle movement.”

Problem Statement

Many vehicles traveling long distances, such as from Pune to Nagpur, lack access to an efficient and low-cost vehicle tracking mechanism. Existing tracking solutions are often expensive or rely on specialized hardware, making them unsuitable for small and medium-scale businesses.

Organizations that depend on vehicle movement over distances exceeding 250 kilometers face challenges in monitoring vehicle progress and receiving timely updates. This issue is more prominent for heavy vehicles operating on highways, where journeys typically take three to four days.

As a result, there is a need for a **feasible, software-based vehicle tracking solution** that reduces dependency on manual communication methods.

Project Objectives

* Track vehicle location using browser-based geolocation
* Enable drivers to update vehicle location manually or at fixed time intervals
* Implement checkpoint-based validation of vehicle routes
* Allow vehicle owners and customers to monitor vehicle location and route status
* Reduce dependency on manual communication methods for vehicle tracking
